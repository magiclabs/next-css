# Better CSS Support for NextJS

> Feature-parity with NextJS built-in CSS, but with the added flexibility to support the pre-processor of your choice.

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) configuration decorator with the goal of approximately mirroring NextJS's [built-in CSS support](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) without losing the flexibility of technology choice. For example, at [Magic Labs](https://magic.link), we are invested in [LESS](http://lesscss.org)! However, the built-in CSS features of NextJS are very desirable, so we created `@magiclabs/next-css` to bridge the gap.

## üîó Installation

`@magiclabs/next-css` is available as an NPM package:

```bash
# Via NPM:
npm install --save @magiclabs/next-css

# Via Yarn:
yarn add @magiclabs/next-css
```

### Peer Dependencies

This module requires NextJS (`^9.5.4 || ^10.0.0`) as a **peer dependency**. Additionally, any Webpack dependencies related to your CSS pre-processor of choice are required to be installed separately.

## üìö Usage

The stylesheet is compiled to `.next/static/css`. Next.js will automatically add the css file to the HTML. In production, a chunk hash is added so that styles are updated when a new version of the stylesheet is deployed.

### Configuration

Create a `next.config.js` in the root of your project (next to `pages/` and `package.json`).

```js
// next.config.js
const { withCSS } = require('@magiclabs/next-css'); // Please note the named export!

module.exports = withCSS({
  // Array of objects configuring any CSS pre-processors you like!
  preProcessors: [
    {
      extensions: [...], // i.e.: ["less"] or ["sass", "scss"]
      use: [...], // Receives same configuration as Webpack > Module > Rule > Use
    },
  ],

  // Also valid as a factory function!
  // Receives the same arguments as a NextJS custom `webpack` function.
  preProcessors: (config, options) => [...],
});
```

### With [LESS](http://lesscss.org)

First, install your LESS-specific dependencies:

```bash
# Via NPM:
npm install --save less less-loader

# Via Yarn:
yarn add less less-loader
```

Next, configure the pre-processor with `@magiclabs/next-css`:

```js
// next.config.js
const { withCSS } = require('@magiclabs/next-css');

module.exports = withCSS({
  // Array of objects configuring any CSS pre-processors you like!
  preProcessors: [
    {
      extensions: ["less"],
      use: [require.resolve('less-loader')],
    },
  ],
});
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs

- More dependencies leads to longer NPM package installation times.
- As this is a re-implementation of NextJS CSS support, there may be some inconsistencies between the end results. NextJS benefits from aggressive internal optimizations which may be missing or unaccounted for here. However, we try our best to match the internal implementation as closely as possible.
- Currently, only **Webpack V4** is officially supported. Whenever NextJS updates to support Webpack V5 by default, `@magiclabs/next-css` will be updated as well.
